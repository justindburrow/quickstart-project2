This is a search page site built for a Quickstart coding bootcamp project.  This utilizes Giphy APA to seach the Giphy gif database and return the results.

The pages can be navigated using the nav bar on top of each page.  Any keyworkd can be submitted on the search bar and the applicable giphy images will be rendered to the site.  The site can be reloaded by clicking the title.

This site uses .html, .css, .js and Bootstrap.

Three things I can improve in the future:
In the future I could utilize the branches feature of GitHub to keep from losing code.
I can also build out the reactive grid layout quicker as it took alot of trial and error to get the images to not run off the page.
I can also utilize my own coding knowlege and the AI bot to build out the code in the most efficient way.
